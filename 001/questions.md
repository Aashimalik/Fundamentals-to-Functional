Dot notation:
  Property identifies can only be alphanumeric (and _ and $)
  Property identifiers cannot start with a number.
  Property identifiers cannot contain variables.
  OK — obj.prop_1, obj.prop$

  Property identifiers have to be a String or a variable that references a String.
  It is okay to use variables, spaces, and Strings that start with numbers
  OK — obj["1prop"], obj["prop name"]

4-How do you add a property whose key and value are stored in different

5-How do we loop through objects to access the values?
6-When can you only use dot Notation and not brackets?
7-When can you only brackets and not dot?
8-How do you add a property with a key that is stored in a variable?
9-How do you access an object that is inside another object?
